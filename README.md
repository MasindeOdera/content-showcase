# Content Showcase Application

The Content Showcase Application is a Proof of Concept (PoC) designed to demonstrate how publications—such as blog articles, case studies, brochures, and ebooks—can be dynamically displayed and filtered through a user-friendly interface. The application connects with an external API that supports pagination and OAuth, enabling users to search and view various content types in an organized manner.

## Features
- Display of content (publications) like blog posts, case studies, etc.
- Search and filter functionality for easy navigation through publications.
- OAuth authentication for secure access to the API.
- Pagination support to manage large datasets.
- Responsive design using Styled Components.

## Tech Stack
- **Vite**: For fast development builds.
